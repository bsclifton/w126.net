## What is this?

My name is Brian Clifton and I love Mercedes-Benz. This blog documents my progress restoring what I personally believe is the most beautiful car that Mercedes-Benz ever made.

If you'd like to get a hold of me, here are a few ways you can:
- [Write me a message](https://clifton.io/about/)
- [View my profile on BenzWorld](https://www.benzworld.org/members/bsclifton.130903/)

Although I haven't updated it in a while, I also love the R129 SL and have a [page with information, including a Buyer's Guide](https://mb.clifton.io/r129/).
